# Notebooks for Homework 2
There are two notebooks 
## Notebook 1: Understanding the Maxwell Boltzman distribution
* Plot the Maxewell Botlzman distribution using special case of Chi distribution using three degree of freedom
* Understand the concept of scale parameter of chi distribution and how it is related to the temperature of the gas
* You will also understand the concept of mean, mode median in this notebook
* Very important concept where the macroscopic properties such as temperature of a gas is estimated using the statistical microscopic properties such as velocity distribution of all the molecues in the gas
## Notebook 2: Understanding the concept of law of large number, central limit theorm and parameter estimation
