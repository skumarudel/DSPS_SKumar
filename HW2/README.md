# Notebooks for Homework 2
There are two notebooks 
## Notebook 1: Understanding the Maxwell Boltzman distribution
* Plot the Maxewell Botlzman distribution using special case of Chi distribution using three degree of freedom
* Understand the concept of scale parameter of chi distribution and how it is related to the temperature of the gas
* You will also understand the concept of mean, mode, median in this notebook
* Very important concept where the macroscopic properties such as temperature of a gas is estimated using the statistical microscopic properties such as velocity distribution of all the molecues in the gas
* Apart from these concepts, I have also shown how to do plotting in jupyter notebooks, drawing random number from a distribution and calculating statistical descriptive parameters using scipy package
## Notebook 2: Understanding the concept of law of large number, central limit theorm and parameter estimation
* GENERATE 100 samples of different sizes N (N>10 & N<2000) from each of 5 different distributions (500 samples in total), all with the same population mean.
* Include a Normal, a Poisson, a Binomial, a Chi-Squared and exponential distribution
* For each sample plot, the sample mean and standard deviation is plotted against the sample size
* Law of large number is verified from these plots as the sample size increases, the sample mean approach sample population mean
* Mean of samples drawn from each distribution is plotted in a histogram to verfiy the central limit theorm
* Fit the mean of samples with a gaussian function to estimate the mean and standard deviation (using unbinned maximum likelihood method)
