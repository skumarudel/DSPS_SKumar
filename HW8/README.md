## Classification of Signal and Background in Higgs data
- Analysis of Higgs boson data for classification of signal and background
- Used Random forest and Gradient boosting for model training
- Check for feature imortance 
- Plot confusion matrix
- Hyperparameter tuning for best out of sample performance (i.e on Test data)
## Regression Analysis to predict the weight of particles in Higgs data
- Use Random Forest and Gradient boosting regressor
- Use both the L2 and L1 loss function to check the performance of the regressor
