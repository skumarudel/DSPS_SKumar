**Part 2**. Plot of significance distribution of `background` data and `signal+background` data
Basically the below plots are one dimensioal significance distribution of 2-dimensional significance maps. In the background map, signal region is masked and in the signal+background map, signal region is not masked. As you see in the signal+background distribution, signal is clearly showing at a 8-9 sigma level, whereas in the background only region, the significance distribution mean at zero and sigma=1, which is consistent with the background fluctuations around a mean of zero.
